#This folder contains multiple Lift project templates:

- lift_advanced_bs3 is a more advanced template that shows Bootstrap 3 integration.
             It uses the Fobo Lift module to provide the integration.

- lift_basic is a basic Lift application with a built-in user class
             and nice use of Blueprint CSS and HTML5


- lift_blank is a blank Lift project that does not have any model
             or CSS

- lift_mvc   is a Lift project that uses Lift's MVC support rather
             than view-first.  No model stuff, but Blueprint CSS

- lift_json  is a Lift project that uses Lift's json library in a specs2 test class
             to demonstrate extractions based on case classes.


##All projects features:

1. specs2
2. logback
3. log back sample xml configuration file (for both, runtime and test)
4. Jetty 9.2.1 (provided by the xsbt-web-plugin)
